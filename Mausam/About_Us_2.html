                    <div class="about-p">Here at Verdant, the belief is that every dish pays homage to 
                    the best of what nature has to offer. We advocate for chance 
                    in vegan dining and seek to infuse a lush, fresh and vibrantly 
                    delicious plant-based cuisine that is as indulgent as it is nourishing.
                     At Verdant, luxury meets sustainability.</div>

                    <div class="about-p">Every ingredient is delicately chosen to bring out the rich flavor of the

                     taste, luxury and creativity. Inspired by the pieces of nature around us, Verdant 
                     embraces the concept of a harmony where each exquisite dish is a work of art that 
                     nurtures the planet.</div>
